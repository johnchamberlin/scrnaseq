## Introduction

Fork of the nf-core scrnaseq repo by John Chamberlin. Goal: enable all STARsolo features to be used. 

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what data the pipeline is for and what it does -->
**nf-core/scrnaseq** is a bioinformatics best-practise analysis pipeline for

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

This is a community effort in building a pipeline capable to support:

* Alevin + AlevinQC
* STARSolo
* Kallisto + BUStools

## Pipeline Summary

By default, the pipeline currently performs the following:

<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of default steps of pipeline -->

* Sequencing quality control (`FastQC`)
* Overall pipeline run summaries (`MultiQC`)

## Documentation

The nf-core/scrnaseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline: [usage](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/usage) and [output](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/output).

## Credits

The `nf-core/scrnaseq` was initiated by [Peter J. Bailey](https://github.com/PeterBailey) (Salmon Alevin, AlevinQC) with major contributions from [Olga Botvinnik](https://github.com/olgabot) (STARsolo, Testdata) and [Alex Peltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer) (Kallisto/BusTools workflow).

We thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development
of this pipeline:

<!-- TODO nf-core: If applicable, make list of people who have also contributed -->

## Contributions and Support

## Citations

The basic benchmarks that were used as motivation for incorporating the three available modular workflows can be found in [this publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/673285v2).

We offer all three paths for the processing of scRNAseq data so it remains up to the user to decide which pipeline workflow is chosen for a particular analysis question.
